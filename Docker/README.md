***Kafka1 & Kafka2***: Provides Kafka messaging services. Both Kafka brokers depend on Zookeeper.

***Custom Application***: It's Maven image for running maven project.

***PostgreSQL***: Database service with user, password, and database configuration.

***Hadoop NameNode***: Manages the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).

***Hadoop DataNode***: Stores HDFS data. Communicates with NameNode and ResourceManager.

***Hadoop ResourceManager***: Manages YARN resources. Relies on NameNode and DataNode.

***Hadoop NodeManager***: Executes tasks on the Hadoop cluster. Depends on ResourceManager and DataNode.

***Hadoop HistoryServer***: Provides history of completed YARN applications.
